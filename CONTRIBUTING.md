## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Linux system (any major distribution)
- Bash 4.0 or higher
- Git
- Basic knowledge of shell scripting

### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LinuxSystemInfo.git
cd LinuxSystemInfo

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Test the scripts
./scripts/sysinfo.sh
./scripts/sysinfo-simple.sh
```

## üìã Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

### üêõ Bug Reports

- Explain the use case and benefit
- Provide implementation suggestions if possible

### üíª Code Contributions
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements

### üåê Platform Support

- Distribution-specific enhancements

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Maintain compatibility with bash 4.0+

### Script Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Function description and purpose

function_name() {
    local variable_name="value"
    
    # Clear, descriptive comments
    command_here
    
    return 0
}
```

### Error Handling
- Always include error checking for critical operations
- Provide graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- Use timeouts for network operations
- Test error conditions thoroughly

### Performance
- Keep execution time reasonable (< 3 seconds for comprehensive mode)
- Cache expensive operations when possible
- Avoid unnecessary external command calls
- Test on older/slower hardware

## üìù Pull Request Process

### 1. Preparation
```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# Test thoroughly on different distributions if possible
```

### 2. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Scripts run without errors on your system
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality  
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed

### 3. Commit Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

```bash
# Good commit messages
Add temperature monitoring for AMD CPUs
Fix memory percentage calculation on Alpine Linux
Update documentation for new installation method

# Poor commit messages  
Fix bug
Update stuff
Changes
```

### 4. Pull Request
- Fill out the pull request template
- Link related issues
- Describe what you changed and why
- Include screenshots for visual changes
- Request review from maintainers

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
Test your changes on:
- Different Linux distributions (if possible)
- Different terminal emulators
- Systems with/without optional dependencies
- Various hardware configurations

### Test Scenarios
- Systems with limited memory
- Systems with high disk usage
- Network connectivity issues
- Missing optional dependencies
- Different shell environments

### Automated Testing
We're working on automated testing infrastructure. In the meantime:
- Test edge cases manually
- Verify fallback behavior
- Check error conditions

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document function parameters and return values
- Explain non-obvious behavior
- Update inline help text

### README Updates
Update relevant sections when:
- Adding new features
- Changing installation procedures
- Modifying dependencies
- Adding distribution support

### Examples
Provide examples for:
- New configuration options
- Custom modifications

## üéØ Feature Development

### Planning Phase
1. **Check existing issues** - Avoid duplicate work
2. **Discuss the feature** - Open an issue to discuss approach
3. **Design considerations** - Think about compatibility and performance
4. **Implementation plan** - Break down into smaller tasks

### Implementation Phase
1. **Start small** - Implement minimum viable version first
2. **Test early and often** - Test on multiple systems
3. **Document as you go** - Update docs alongside code
4. **Get feedback** - Share work-in-progress for early feedback

### Common Enhancement Areas

#### Hardware Detection
- New CPU architectures
- Additional GPU vendors (AMD, Intel)
- More hardware sensors
- USB device information

#### Software Detection
- Additional programming languages
- More development tools
- Container platforms (Podman, LXC)
- Database systems

#### Display Improvements
- New themes or color schemes
- Alternative layouts
- Responsive terminal sizing
- Export formats (JSON, XML)

#### System Integration
- Systemd integration
- Cron job templates
- Monitoring system plugins
- Shell integration improvements
